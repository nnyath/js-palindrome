# Post-Mortem Whiteboard for Palindrome Testing

Just some thoughts about improving the implemention of testing palindromes in Javascript for a whiteboard

General improvment thought process is as follows
* Unit testing
* Taking advantage of native JS functions
* More eloquent approach using the original approach

---

## This will run through each approach including the original approach

To test and run
```
npm install
npm start
```

To test
```
npm test
```
