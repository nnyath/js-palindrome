# Post-Mortem Whiteboard for Palindrome Testing

Just some thoughts about improving the implemention of testing palindromes in Javascript for a whiteboard

General improvment thought process is as follows
* Unit testing
* Taking advantage of native JS functions
* More eloquent approach using the original approach
* Trying a possible RegExp approach

### TODO

- [x] Setup Unit Testing
- [x] Implement Original Approach
- [x] Implement Improved Original Approach
- [x] Implement Approach using ES5 JS API
- [ ] Implement RegExp approach
- [ ] Implement Timers for Each Approach For Speed Comparisons

---

## This will run through each approach currently implemented

To test and run
```
npm install
npm start
```

To test
```
npm test
```
